# Exercises

If not done already, complete the following guides.

From last week:

- [Installing JupyterLab](../V2/install_jupyterlab.md)
- [V2 Exercise](../V2/v2_exercises.md)

Guides this week:

- [Preparing Dataset](./preparing_dataset.md)
- [Setup JupyterLab](./jupyter_lab.md)
- [Tuning your Cluster](./tuning_yarn.md)
- [Installing MrJob](./install_mrjob.md)

## MRJob

For the rest of this exercise, we will use `MrJob`. To get a feeling how `MrJob` works open the [./v3_exercises_material/1_MRJob/MrJob.ipynb](./v3_exercises_material/1_MRJob/MrJob.ipynb) in your `JupyterLab` environment.

## Word Count

We will have three sub exercises in this section:

1. Reimplement the word-count we did last week with MrJob.
2. Enhance the word-count with a preprocessing.
3. Sort the results where the most frequent words are on top.

The `Jupyter` notebooks are located in the folder [./v3_exercises_material/2_WordCount/](./v3_exercises_material/2_WordCount/).
